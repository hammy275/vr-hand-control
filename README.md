# VR Hand Control

This Minecraft mod is a work-in-progress! Despite the name, don't get your hopes up! This is mainly being made for my personal enjoyment, at least at the moment.

## Credits

Thanks to DenTechs for the [Python Implementation](https://github.com/DenTechs/VirtualDesktop_ReadMMF) that the `common/src/main/java/com/hammy275/vrhandcontrol/client/vr_data` package is based on (mainly `VRDataGrabber.java` in that package).
